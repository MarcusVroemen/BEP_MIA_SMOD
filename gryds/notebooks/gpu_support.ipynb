    "# Faster interpolation and transformation using the GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "Gryds has GPU support for the interpolation and deformable transformations. From our own testing, we know that this can give a significant speed improvement for 3D images.\n",
    "\n",
    "By executing the interpolation on the GPU, we obtain a 2-3 times speed-up. Shown below is a curve for the number of seconds of GPU vs CPU linear interpolation as a function of image size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPU execution has some overhead, that means that for smaller images (i.e. 2D images) the CPU implementation is still faster. Starting from an image size of 6 x 128 x 128 the GPU version is significantly faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](cupy_interpolation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we also run the *transformation* on the GPU, the speed-up is even larger: about seven times faster.\n",

Once installed, Gryds will automatically import the `BSplineInterpolatorCuda` and `BSplineTransformationCuda` classes, that you can use exactly like the normal `BSplineInterpolator` and `BSplineTransformationCuda` classes.
