1. ***Table 3 caption:***\
    Quantitative evaluation results of the inter-patient (i.e., the JHU dataset) and the atlas-to-patient (i.e., the IXI dataset) brain MRI registration <s>(left table), and XCAT-to-CAT registration (right table) </s>. Dice score and percentage of voxels with a non-positive Jacobian determinant (i.e., folded voxels) are evaluated for different methods. The bolded numbers denote the highest scores, while the italicized ones indicate the second highest.

2. ***Table 6 caption:***\
    System-level comparison of various TransMorph designs and the customized VoxelMorph **on the validation** and test datasets of inter-patient MRI, **atlas-to-patient MRI,** and XCAT-to-CT registration tasks. ‘‘Val. DSC’’ denotes the Dice scores on the validation dataset; ‘‘Test DSC’’ denotes the system-level comparison of the Dice scores on the test dataset. The bolded numbers denote the highest scores, while the italicized ones indicate the second highest.

3. ***Section 4.1.1 & 4.1.2:***\
    Label maps including <s>29</s> **30** anatomical structures were obtained using FreeSurfer for evaluating registration performances.

4. ***Section 4.1.2:***\
    This dataset contains a total of 451 brain <s>T2</s> **T1** MRI images, with 394, 19, and 38 images being used for training, validation, and testing, respectively.
