# Bachelor End Project of Lars Daenen
This repository contains the code used during the Bachelor End Project (BEP) on validation of deformable image registration (DIR) for thoracic 4DCT.
The main purpose of the BEP was to validate three sets of parameters for DIR of thoracic 4DCT based on the Jacobian determinant and landmark registration error.

The thoracic 4DCT data and the corresponding landmarks used can be downloaded on https://med.emory.edu/departments/radiation-oncology/research-laboratories/deformable-image-registration/downloads-and-reference-data/4dct.html
